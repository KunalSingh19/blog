### Unlimited Gmail Accounts!

#### Use them for FREE Unlimited Trials on many programmes!

1)At first You Must have Just 1 Gmail Account <br>
2)Then go to the site [Click here](https://thebot.net/api/gmail/) and put that account name here (without @gmail.com)
<br>3)Just press "Generate" and you will get Thousands of FREE ACCOUNTS.<br>
4)They are all Connected with your first account so YOU JUST USE THE NORMAL MAIL INBOX FOR ALL THE ACCOUNTS!!!

So if I send a mail to any of these accounts you just check it on the inbox of the first account.<br>
If you wanna access to youtube, drive,ecc just use the first (the original) accounts
